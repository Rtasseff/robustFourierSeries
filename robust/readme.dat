This code was taken directly from scikits statsmodels.  (http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/install.html)

The robustFourierSeries code is dependent on this module, 
but to avoid needing the whole program I simply 
pulled out the relevent parts here. 
All of the code from statsmodels was originaly published under
the  Modified (3-clause) BSD license at http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.
